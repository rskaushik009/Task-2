2. How to identify a phishing email?

Phishing emails often have:

- A sense of urgency or threats (e.g., “Your account will be locked”)
- Spelling/grammar mistakes
- Suspicious links or attachments
- Generic greetings (“Dear Customer”)
- Email addresses that don’t match the real domain

3. What is email spoofing?

Email spoofing is when an attacker forges the “From” address in an email header to make it look like it’s coming from a trusted source, even though it’s not. This technique is commonly used in phishing.

5. How can you verify the sender’s authenticity?

- Hover over links before clicking to see the real URL

- Contact the sender through official channels (not by replying to the email)

6. What tools can analyze email headers?

- MXToolbox Header Analyzer
- Google Admin Toolbox Message Header

7. What actions should be taken on suspected phishing emails?

- `Do not click` on any links or attachments
- `Report` the email to your IT/security team or email provider

- `Delete` the email after reporting
- Use endpoint protection tools to scan the system for threats if clicked

8. How do attackers use social engineering in phishing?

Attackers manipulate human behavior by:

- Creating fake urgency (“Reset password now!”)
- Posing as authority figures (boss, bank officer)
- Exploiting trust and emotions (e.g., fake charity requests or prizes)
- Using personalized details from social media to craft believable messages
